This project is licensed under the terms of the EUPL-1.2 license.

The python files used in this project are found in the "scripts" directory. The results from the simulations in the paper are in the "data" directory, specifically "\data\res - 20231004 - HSL w itertime" and "\data\res - 20231004 - mumps w itertime". This data can be plotted by using the file "\scripts\plot_results.py". There is therefore no need to rerun the simulations to investigate the plots.

If you want to rerun simulations, use the file "\scripts\main_run_all_mpc.py". A (very) brief description of what the file does is included inside the file. When you rerun simulations, the new data will be stored in "\data\res", hence, you do not overwrite the data used in the article.

Information about Python version and package versions are found in "Python version and packages.txt".
